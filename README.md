# ToDoList

The most common tutorial is a ToDo list. Which is nice, but most of the time it stops ToDoList with having a the list and maybe adding items. At best you can mark them as completed. What about recurrence? What about storing them in a database? 

My goal is to make a ToDo list that I would like. Something for me. Something that I would enjoy. One which can have multiple types of clients and a robust back-end. 

This repo is where I try to do just that.
